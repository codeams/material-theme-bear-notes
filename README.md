# Material Palenight Theme for Bear Notes (macOS)

Bear uses XML for their themes which makes it rather easy to create your own. Unfortunately they do not support third party themes. To install this theme you must name and copy over a theme included with Bear. I chose Dark Graphite.

Installing this theme requires some good ol' copy / pasting within the Bear app's package contents.

I offer no support for this. This is just me modifying the app to fit the theme I use in other apps and letting anyone interested in on the fun.

ps. I did not create Bear and am not affiliated with it and its creators in any manner.
