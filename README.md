# Material Palenight Theme for Bear Notes (macOS)

Bear uses XML for their themes which makes it rather easy to create your own. Unfortunately they do not support third party themes. To install this theme you must name and copy over a theme included with Bear. I chose Dark Graphite.

Installing this theme requires some good ol' copy / pasting within the Bear app's package contents.

## Instructions

1. If open, quit Bear.
2. Go to your Applications folder.
3. Locate and Right-Click on Bear. Select "Show Package Contents."
4. Navigate to `Contents/Resources`. 
5. Create backups for `Dark Graphite App Theme.theme` and `Dark Graphite Text Theme.theme`.
6. Overwrite those files with the ones included within this repo.
7. Open Bear and make sure Dark Graphite is the selected theme.

I offer no support for this. This is just me modifying the app to fit the theme I use in other apps and letting anyone interested in on the fun.

❤️

ps. I did not create Bear and am not affiliated with it and its creators in any manner.
